+ The data set created has 180 rows and 81 columns where the first two columns show the unique combinations of subjects (30) and activities (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying). 
+ The rest of the variables represent the average of measurements that were collected in the study. These are either the averages of the mean or standard deviations for some specific measurements. 
+ The measurements are either in the form of time or frequency recorded by the accelerometer and gyroscope on three dimensions (XYZ). All measurements, whether in seconds or Hz, were normalized and bounded -1 to +1. The measurements of accelerometer are represented in the form of body (e.g. Time-Body Acceleration mean on X) and gravity acceleration signals (e.g. Time-Gravity Acceleration mean on X). 
+ The gyroscope measurements are displayed as the body angular assessments (e.g. Time-Body Angular std on X).
Some of the measurements are jerk signals that are calculated based on the body linear acceleration and angular velocity (e.g. Time-Body Angular Jerk std on X). 
+ The magnitude of the signals, calculated by Euclidean norm) are also presented as another variable of interest (e.g. Time-Body Angular Jerk Magnitude mean)
